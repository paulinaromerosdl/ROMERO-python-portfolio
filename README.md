# 👁️‍🗨️ AT A GLANCE
This is a collection of upcoming Python projects showcasing skills in data analysis, visualization, and software development. This portfolio includes will include interactive dashboards, data storytelling, time series analysis, and advanced data structures like arrays, stacks, and trees. Each project highlights practical applications of Python in handling, transforming, and visualizing data. Hopefully, I will be able to develop both soft and technical skills, and expand my understanding of other programming languages including python.

## Here are projects for the semester:
💻 Basic Streamlit App: The Streamlit app is a coding framework that simplifies learning models and Python projects without using web coding languages.

⚙️ Tidy Data Project: The aim for this project is to be able to analyze a dataset that contains information about sports and gender-based medal counts through the use of Tidy Data Principles. These principles help format the data, and clean null values to make the data more readable.

📖 NER App Project: This app uses a Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) tool built using spaCy and its EntityRuler component. It allows users to input or upload text and define a custom entity patterns, and visualize recognized entities in real-time. This project has been the most challenging out of the three, it has incorporated skills from all projects.
