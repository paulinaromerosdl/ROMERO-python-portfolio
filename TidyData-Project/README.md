# 📈 Tidy Data Project 
## ⭐ Purpose 
The aim for this project is to be able to analyze a dataset that contains information about sports and gender-based medal counts through the use of Tidy Data Principles. These principles help format the data, and clean null values to make the data more readable. 

## 🔧 Features
Some features included in this project are: columns, rows, visualization types, and tables. 

To be able to run the notebook make sure you have Python libraries installed- if you do not have a Python library you can install it using the 'pip':'''bash 
pip install pandas matplotlib command in your terminal

As previously mentioned this dataset contains information on medal counts across various sports, the columns included are Sport_gender which show the specific category of gender in a sport. Then medalist_name is the name of the medalist, and medals the number of medals. 

Some of the preprocessing steps included replaced the 'NaN' values with a 0 to handle the missing data, then reformatting the data set using the 'pd.melt()' design, and finally splitting the sport_gender column into a separate column for sport, and a separate column for gender.
